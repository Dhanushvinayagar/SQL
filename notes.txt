1.Views vs CTEs:
View 
- it will create a virtual table of the original table. 
- All the operations performed on the view will be performed on the original table.

CTE 
- it will create a temporary table that can be used in a query.
- Treated as a seperate entity and can be used in multiple queries.

2.PROC over MODIFIES SQL DATA in function
 - Not a good practice use PROCEDURE instead
 - Because heavy data modification, business logic and transaction can be handled by PROCEDURE in a better way

3.DELIMITER
- used to delimit the start and end of the function
- ';' is used to delimit the end of the function
- Since we use multiple query and statement ';' will cause issue 
- so we use DELIMITER $$ to delimit the start and end of the function
- ADD DELIMITER ; at the end to restore the default delimiter
Example:

DELIMITER $$
    SQL CODE 
$$

DELIMITER ;

4. BEGIN DECLARE END RETURN
- BEGIN - is used to start the function
- DECLARE - is used to declare a variable
- END - is used to end the function
- RETURN - is used to return the value
Template:

DELIMITER $$
    CREATE PROCEDURE PROCEDURE_NAME()
    BEGIN

    END $$
DELIMITER ; 

5. Like vs Regex

Like - to search for a pattern in a string basic wildecards(%, _) and faster (can use index)
Regex - to search for a pattern in a string more advanced wildecards slower than Like also cannot use index

6. EXISTS vs IN vs ANY

EXISTS - Returns TRUE if the subquery returns at least one row.(More faster) . Handle nulls
IN - to check if a value is in a list (Good for less values in the list)
ANY - to check if any value in a list meets a condition used in comparision
IN and ANY are more likly same.

7 . Window function - 

- Mysql default -> RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
- Because during execution it will start from the first row and end at the current row 
- For 'n'th row it has no knowlege about the n+m row (m could be 1,2,....)

- But in LAST_VALUE and NTH_VALUE we need N+m row details so we use :
   ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
